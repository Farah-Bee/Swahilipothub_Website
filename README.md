The task: Creating a website that speaks about Swahilipot Hub and making it look and work well.
Stack: React Vite/Next.js Pages Router (Choose between Javascript and Typescript - whatever suits your team)

Instructions

    Using a template (for inspiration or as a base for development), create a website with stunning UI that talks about Swahilipot Hub and all it is about.
    Observe Accessibility (to allow for the disabled to be able to use the website with ease)
    Use the same structure as that of the current website in terms of the pages, i.e. whatever pages are in the main website, have them in your project too.
    Use the images present in the website in your project. Nothing more will be provided for your project other than what is available there.


Key features that will be reviewed once the project is done

    Performance: Is your website's loading times optimal?
    UI: Is the website good to the eye/appealing? Nothing too bright or too dull
    Accessibility: Can the website be used by people with disabilities?
    Collaboration: Did every team member play a part in the development of the project?
    Planning and Strategy: How did the team plan on development?
